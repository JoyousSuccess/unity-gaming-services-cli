# Remote-Config Module

This module is an interface to make calls to the Remote-Config UGS service.

Currently, you may only deploy remote-config files with the `ugs deploy` command.

To learn how to create remote config files, please see [documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.remote-config@3.2/manual/Authoring/remote_config_files.html)
